I apologize for leaving this message in this manner but can't find a way to contact you.  
I gave https://twcloud.github.io/tw5-dropbox/ full access to my DropBox and now I would like to revoke it.
I can't find any way on this site or on DropBox.com to do this.

Please let me know how I can revoke the access.
